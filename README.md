## Logseq Telegram Importer

PoC plugin to download stuff from telegram (aka it works good enough for me).  
This just pulls the updates when you open up telegram.

## Reason

I usually follow news from telegram and use logseq to track my article/repos/stuff to check queue, so yeah...

## Building & usage
 
To build:
`parcel build --public-url . --no-source-maps index.html`  

Place the Telegram API token and your user ID in the plugin settings.
